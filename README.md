# S.M.A.R.T. API for .NET developers

### An S.M.A.R.T. drive information API for .NET developers

![App](Images/App.png)

------------------

## üëã Introduction

S.M.A.R.T. API is a class library (dll file) that illustrates how to retrieve S.M.A.R.T. information from a disk drive using managed code. 

The source-code is written in VB.NET, and targets .NET Framework 4.8. The source-code is fully reusable, personalizable and scalable, you can copy it and paste on your own works.

The source-code comes with a demonstration through a desktop application that shows the S.M.A.R.T. info of your drives.

## ‚ÄºÔ∏è Limitations

This tool does not pretend to be a professional S.M.A.R.T. tool software. 

Because the representation of the vendor-specific RAW values always needs further investigation, this tool has what we could consider a limitation in the meaning of being incapable to determine when a vendor-specific RAW value should be represented as a 64, 48 or 32 bit integer, because that is work of the developer itself. This is normal and understandable, because as I mentioned, this application does not pretend to be a professional tool.

For the reason being said, my implementation tries to facilitate this task by providing properties to show the RAW value in different representations. 

Anyway, almost all the vendor-specific RAW values are 32-bit integer values, which is the default kind of value represented in the user-interface of this tool.
